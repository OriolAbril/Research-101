# Research 101

Repository containing the materials (slides, links, jupyter notebooks...) from 
the weekly meetings.

## What?
The goal of these weekly meeting will be to show and explain how to use some tool that we think can be useful and/or interesting to everyone. The goal would be to keep the workload of speakers (that is ourselves) to a minimum, so talks/workshops will be based on speaker availability first. To ease the preparation, make the workshop about following a tutorial you like, reuse slides from
other talks...

## How?
The meeting topics will be agreed on between all of us trying to match the
interests of everybody. The material for the talks will be uploaded to this 
repository (it is a public repository, therefore act acordingly).
