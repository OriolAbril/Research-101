Repository containing the materials (slides, links, jupyter notebooks...) from 
the weekly meetings.

## What?
The goal of these weekly meeting will be to get to know each others current 
research and research interests and to help each other keep learning both 
inside the resepctive research field and outside of it.

## How?
The meeting topics will be agreed on between all of us trying to match the
interests of everybody. The material for the talks will be uploaded to this 
repository (it is private in case somebody wanted to share not yet published 
reseach).
